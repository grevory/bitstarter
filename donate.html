      <h3>What Ultimate League?</h3>
      <p><img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/200/sports?v=1" class="visible-md pull-left img-thumbnail in-text">Ultimate League is application for ultimate frisbee organizers. It is meant to be used for leagues and tournaments. There are not an abundance of quality league management apps available for ultimate frisbee organizers so Ultimate League is looking to fill that void.</p>
      <p>The idea is for ultimate leagues across North America to have access to a system that will allow any league to have a beautiful website for <strong class="text-warning">free</strong>.</p>
      <p>Our system will be built for mobile first since everyone has their phone on the sideline of a game.</p>
      <p>We will handle 100% of the payment on the organizers behalf. No one likes to waste time meddling with payment transactions when there are so many things that require the league organizers attention. We automate the entire process from acception money to issuing refunds.</p>
      <p>Speaking of automating, we want to automate scheduling. It has to cause the most headaches so let us randomize a schedule for the season and then you can mess with the dates to get the schedule to work exactly how you need it to work.</p>

      <h3>Why should I care?</h3>
      <p>If you have no interest in ultimate you shouldn't care. But I'm guessing if you read this far you have some interest in ultimate.</p>
      <p>Here is why I care.</p>
      <p>I was at a well-organized tournament in Toronto recently and each captain was afforded a printed copy of the schedule on a loose sheet of paper. Needless to say with all the moving from field to field a sheet of paper does not last very well, if it doesn't get lost along the way. I noticed that everyone was checking the schedule from their mobiles. And of course they would. The tournament had a website. The only problem was that the schedule was completely unreadable to a human being on a desktop computer and infitiely worse on a handheld screen. <strong>There was a obvious need for a mobile-friendly schedule</strong>.</p>
      <p>Of course why stop there? Everything should be easily accessible by your phone.</p>

        <h3>What will the money be used for?</h3>
        <p>Building a web app can be done with very little up-front capital investment, but every for a seasoned developer like me there are costs that will need to be addressed.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of costs that will be covered by your generous investment:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Online advertisement</strong><br>We will leverage highly-targeting online advertising to create brand awareness. This service can only work if it is made into a sustainble business so fast expansion once the product is available is key.</li>
          <li><strong>Services used</strong><br>Hosting and domain registration are costs that are mostly beyond our control. We can keep them low, but we cannot avoid them. The more traffic we get the more costly hosting can become.</li>
          <li><strong>Graphic design</strong><br>While I am able to prepare most of what I need through free resources and my own design skills, there is no good substitute for a talented designer on your side.</li>
